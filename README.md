# Authentication-with-Passport.js

Authentication with Passport.js which is an authentication middleware for Node.js. Read more about it [here](http://www.passportjs.org/)

For frontend, used [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) which is templating library for Nodejs.

Used Sequelize library, Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. With Sequelize, you don't need to write SQL anymore, it allows you create objects. Read about it [here](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/).

In this case for sequelize, MySQL must be downloaded and running in your computer.

I have used MySQL 5.7 which can downloaded from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/). Download mysql-installer-community-5.7.26.0.msi


### Nodejs must be installed

To install Sequelize, MySQL, Passport and Express you need to run:

`npm init` for initialzing
`npm install express express-session` for installing express
`npm install hbs` for installing Handlebars
`npm install passport passport-local` for installing passport and passport-local means that we will use local storage
`npm install sequelize` for installing sequelize
`npm install mysql2` for installing MySQL2
